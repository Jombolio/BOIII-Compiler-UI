						File->Port IL Project (Recommened if you are using an IL Project, otherwise: it may not work at all)

	* How to:
						What you will see when you open the UI is the default project for Black Ops 3: 
						Everytime you create a new project, it will always startout as the default one and this will be
						based on the selected game you have (it will default to be Black Ops 3)
						
						From there you can select another menu via File->Open Folder (make sure the scripts you want to compile are in a subfolder called scripts
						this is also required inorder to use the editor, it will only pickup files within the scripts folder)
						
						Select your game, gamemode and hit compile: if you get an error make sure you are injecting for the correct game
